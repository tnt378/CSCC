#1 How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
#You can use git log --stat to see the changed files and their relative changes.

#2 How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
#You can use git log --patch to see the exact changes with a code (color coded and symbols) to distinguish the types of changes.

#3 What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)
#The head is the top of the branch, or the most recent commit.
